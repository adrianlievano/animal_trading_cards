			<p>Octopuses are ocean creatures
				that are most famous for having eight arms and bulbous heads.
				Some other fun facts: They have three hearts and blue blood; they squirt
				ink to deter predators; and being boneless, they can squeeze into (or out of)
				tight spaces. They are quite intelligent and have been observed using tools.</p>
